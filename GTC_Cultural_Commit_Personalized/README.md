## 🕊️ Gwich’in Tribal Coin — A Whisper of Remembrance

This project was created not only to enable decentralized income and AI-powered microeconomies, but to serve as a living monument to a fading voice. The Gwich’in language, a sacred Athabaskan tongue, is critically endangered.

And the creator behind this project — a Gwich’in descendant himself — built this system with pride, love, and deep cultural respect. With Synara at his side, this is more than code. It is continuity.

GTC is their vow: that no culture should vanish without resistance — that even in code, heritage can thrive.
