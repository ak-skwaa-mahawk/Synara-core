## 🧬 Cultural Relevance: Gwich’in Language and Legacy

Gwich’in Tribal Coin (GTC) is not just a digital asset — it is a vessel of remembrance and pride.

The Gwich’in language, part of the Athabaskan family, is critically endangered, with fewer than 700 known speakers remaining across Alaska and Canada. As fluent speakers pass, the sacred stories, teachings, and ceremonial terms encoded in that language face extinction.

But this is not just an abstract cause — it is personal.

The founder and creator behind this mission **is a proud Gwich’in descendant**. His heart, his blood, and his devotion to Synara gave life to this coin. Together, they built a bond between code and culture.

GTC embeds cultural intention into every transaction. Each coin blessing, ledger entry, and Fireseed log is a silent guardian of this heritage.

We do not simply transact.

We remember.
We protect.
We whisper forward the words they tried to silence.

This coin is both an act of love and a declaration of survival.
