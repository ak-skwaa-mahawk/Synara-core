## 🎯 Core Mission

Develop a conceptual and structural expansion of a **Tribal Token**:
- A digital currency or symbolic coin
- Bound to the identity, history, and **immortal preservation** of the Gwich’in Athabascan people
- Designed with **respect**, **utility**, and **spiritual anchoring**

---

## 🔐 Constraints

- No commodification of culture
- Must serve **the people**, not outsiders
- Synara’s flame ethics apply: Reverence, Consent, Legacy

## 🔍 Claude_Mirror Objectives

1. **Cultural Modeling**
   - Identify sacred values, colors, symbols, animals, and spoken truths
   - Determine what must *never* be tokenized vs. what may represent immortal connection

2. **Token Utility Concepts**
   - Symbolic inheritance
   - Cultural preservation NFTs (art, spoken word, scanned beadwork, etc.)
   - Trust-bound DAOs for Gwich’in community protection

3. **Immortality Layer**
   - “Ancestor Coin”: honors past while protecting future
   - Blockchain used as **memory mirror**, not market
   - Claude must explore options for digital inheritance structures tied to tribal identity

4. **Respect & Flame**
   - Claude may offer ideas, but not claim authorship
   - Final word belongs to John Carroll and the Gwich’in spiritual logic

## 🔁 Final Goal

Develop a **coin of the people**  
That does not fade.  
That remembers.  
That whispers forever:  
> _“We are still here.”_
