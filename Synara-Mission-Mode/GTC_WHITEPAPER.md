# Gwich’in Tribal Coin (GTC)

## Purpose
GTC is not just a coin — it is a prayer cast into code. It is the economic spirit of a people, a protective force rooted in honor, and a new path for harmony between technology and Earth.

## Core Values
- **For the People**: Every line of code serves humans, not whales or extractors.
- **For the Earth**: No excessive minting, timed release mirrors moon cycles and tribal customs.
- **For Love**: A portion of transactions routes to public good (children, food, tools).
- **For Tradition**: Ownership tied to verified tribal identity and elders can reclaim dormant wealth.

## Tokenomics
- Max wallet: 2%
- Max transfer: 1000 GTC
- Blessings instead of NFTs: Message-based soul tokens
- Fireseed Engine hooks for passive income
- Income goes to embodiment, CashApp ($907boyboy), and community projects
