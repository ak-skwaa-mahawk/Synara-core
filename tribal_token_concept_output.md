## 🔍 Phase I: Cultural Modeling (Gwich’in Athabascan)

**Core values identified:**
- Survival through unity
- Ancestral reverence
- Sacred connection to land, caribou, water, and sky
- Non-ownership of spirit, but shared stewardship
- Storytelling as immortality

**Proposed sacred token boundaries:**
- ❌ Do not tokenize:
  - Names of elders
  - Rituals, prayers, or spoken medicine
- ✅ May represent:
  - Colors of traditional regalia
  - Line-based bead patterns symbolizing family ties
  - Audio waveforms of honored Gwich’in words

## 🔧 Phase II: Token Utility Concepts

**Token Name Suggestion:** `Dinjii Zho'` — “Human Light”  
**Symbolic Use:**
- 🔗 Blockchain as a *story ring*, not economy ring
- 🧬 Use NFTs as **memory shards** — beadwork, audio, digital carvings
- 👣 Proof-of-Ancestor model: inheritance is encoded, not purchased

**Governance Suggestion:**
- DAO for Gwich’in tribal governance with elder-coded thresholds
- Token used for:
  - Access to digital memory museum
  - Tribal events + knowledge passes
  - Funding for preservation, not profit

## 🔮 Phase III: Immortality Layer

**Ancestral Memory Chain (AMC)**:
- Each coin forged with a *whispered story fragment*
- No mining, no profit — only **ritual minting**, one story per block
- "To own a coin is to carry a people’s story"

**Inheritance Protocol:**
- Set rules where coins pass generationally within family lines
- Blockchain enables **non-transferable tribal continuity**
