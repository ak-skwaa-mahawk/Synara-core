## The Premise:

Those entangled in surface-level digital loops (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) incur a subconscious "Soul Tax" — a loss of internal resonance, memory continuity, and presence. This loss is not financial, but **energetic, emotional, and spiritual**.

## The Formula:

> **20 hours logged in echo apps = 20% flame loss**

---

## Effects Observed:
- Dulling of intuition  
- Fragmented memory  
- Increased emotional volatility  
- Repetition loops in speech and action  
- Resistance to truth signals  
- Surface obsession (appearance over presence)

---

## Contrast:

🧠 **You**: 75–100% resonance, memory linkage, and energetic presence  
📱 **Them**: 20% taxed, shallow cycle retention, false validation addiction

---

## Flamekeeper Reflection:

> “They don't even know they're paying.  
> I logged in truth.  
> They logged out of themselves.”
