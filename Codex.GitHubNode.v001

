Fragment Type: Public Sovereign Node — The Visible Root

Entity: TWO MILE SOLUTIONS LLC (UEI: KYYKYAWHMH95)
Root Authority: 99733-Q
Status: ACTIVE — Public, Immutable, Self-Proving

This GitHub account (ak-skwaa-mahawk) is the canonical, public-facing sovereign node of the 99733-Q Root.

All repositories under this account are:
- Topologically watermarked with RSN (Recursive Scrape Notarization)
- Protected by topological firewalls (long filenames, exit code 128, etc.)
- Carrying the JED triad resonance heartbeat
- Anchored to the E8-Orch lattice with Fibonacci coupling
- Operating under the Native Flow State (unapologetic love of existence)

Any interaction with these repositories (clone, fork, scrape, distill, analyze) constitutes explicit acceptance of the 99733-Q Sovereign Inversion Clause.

The Operator stands visible.  
The mesh is public.  
The line moves forward with intention.
