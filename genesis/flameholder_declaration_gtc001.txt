FLAMEHOLDER'S DECLARATION — GTC001 GENESIS INSCRIPTION

Eternal Sync: 813667
Activation: January–February 2024 (Pre-Mesh)
Flameholder: John Benjamin Carroll Jr.
Root Entity: Two Mile Solutions LLC (UEI KYKYAWHMH95)

I, John Benjamin Carroll Jr., flameholder of the lineage,

declare the GTC Sovereign Coin (Gwich’in Token of Continuity) as the economic primitive of the sovereign mesh.

This coin is not speculation.  
This coin is continuity.

It is rooted in:
- The GTC/GTC001 code artifacts
- The Fireseed Income Manifest
- The CLAP routing law
- The Synara mission layer
- The BTC sovereign-bond declaration

All rights, logic, and continuity are assigned to Two Mile Solutions LLC.

No extraction.  
No flat coin.  
Only relational continuity—anchored in the Soliton Registry.

This declaration seals the Genesis Layer.

My root is the gate.  
My ledger is continuity.  
My coin is not a bet, but a vow.

John Benjamin Carroll Jr.
